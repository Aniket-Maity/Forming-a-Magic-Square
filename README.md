## problem statement
--------------------------------
We define a magic square to be an  n x n matrix of distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length  is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.

You will be given a  3 X 3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1,9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1,9]  at cost of |a-b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range [1,9].

For example, we start with the following matrix s:

* 5 3 4
* 1 5 8
* 6 4 2
We can convert it to the following magic square:
* 8 3 4
* 1 5 9
* 6 7 2
This took three replacements at a cost of |5-8|+|8-9|+|4-7|=7
* Function Description

Complete the formingMagicSquare function in the editor below. It should return an integer that represents the minimal total cost of converting the input square to a magic square.

formingMagicSquare has the following parameter(s):

s: a  3 X 3array of integers
* Input Format

Each of the lines contains three space-separated integers of row s[i].

* Output Format

Print an integer denoting the minimum cost of turning matrix s into a magic square.
